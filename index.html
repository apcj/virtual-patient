      <h2>Case 1.1</h2>
      <p class="question">What brought you into hospital today?</p>
      <p class="answer">I’ve been having this really bad pain in my chest.</p>

      <p class="question">Could you tell me a bit more about the pain?</p>
      <p class="answer">It woke me up this morning at about 6am. I got up, walked around at bit…hoping it would settle down, but nothing I do seems to help.
      I tried taking some gaviscon, but that hasn’t done anything.
      I’m really worried it might be something serious – I’ve not had anything like this before.</p>

      <p class="question">Can you describe it for me?</p>
      <p class="answer">I can’t really describe it… It just feels like tightness, like a weight resting on my chest.</p>

      <p class="question">Any sharp pains when you breathe in or burning pain?</p>
      <p class="answer">No, it’s no worse when I breathe in and I wouldn’t say it was burning at all. I do get acid reflux from time to time, which feels like that, but that’s nothing like this.</p>

      <p class="question">Does the pain go anywhere else?</p>
      <p class="answer">Yes, I can feel it in my left arm too.</p>

      <p class="question">Have you noticed any other symptoms?</p>
      <p class="answer">I feel a bit short of puff at the moment, but I think that’s just ‘cos of the pain.
      I do feel a bit sick, but I haven’t been sick.</p>

      <p class="question">Have you had any cough or fever?</p>
      <p class="answer">No I’ve not had any cough. I haven’t checked my temperature, but I haven’t been feeling hot.</p>

      <p class="question">Have you had any other medical problems before?</p>
      <p class="answer">I’m generally pretty healthy – I haven’t had any medical problems or ever been in hospital before.</p>

      <p class="question">Do you take any regular medication?</p>
      <p class="answer">I’m on some tablets for my blood pressure, but I haven’t any problems with it – well, my GP hasn’t mentioned its been too high.</p>

      <p class="question">Do you know what it is called?</p>
      <p class="answer">Amlodopine, I think – is that how you say it? Ten milligrams.
      Anything other medications?
      Oh, I do take simvastatin too, I have had some high cholesterol levels.
      Anything else?
      No, nothing else.</p>

      <p class="question">Are you diabetic or ever been told you have high blood sugar?</p>
      <p class="answer">My GP did mention my blood sugar was borderline before  - I’ve had some blood tests, but I don’t take anything for it.</p>

      <p class="question">Do you have any family history of heart problems at all?</p>
      <p class="answer">My mum had some heart problems in her later years, and she died of a heart attack when she was 90. My brother has angina too – that’s my younger brother. My older brother is fine.
      Can I ask how old your younger brother is?
      He’s 54</p>

      <p class="question">Do you smoke?</p>
      <p class="answer">Yeah, I’ve been trying to quit, I know it’s bad for me…I have cut down recently – I probably smoke about 15 a day?
      And do you drink alcohol?
      Yes I do drink but not much – maybe a beer or 2 a week.
      Have you ever taken any recreational drugs?
      No I’ve never taken recreational drugs.</p>
